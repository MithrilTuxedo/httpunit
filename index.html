<P>The normal way to access web sites is via a browser; however, there are times when it is desirable to
bypass the browser and access a site from a program, including:
<UL><LI><A HREF="doc/automated-testing.html">automated web site testing</A>
<LI>using a web-site as part of a distributed application</UL>

HttpUnit makes this easy. Written in Java,
HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, including
form submission, basic <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt">http authentication</A>,
cookies and automatic page redirection, and allows
Java test code to examine returned pages as text, an XML DOM, or containers of forms, tables, and links.</P>
<P>
A companion framework, <A HREF="doc/servletunit-intro.html">ServletUnit</A> is included in the download.

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<blockquote>

<strong>HttpUnit</strong> is a free, <A HREF="doc/license.html">open source</A> Java API for accessing web sites without a browser,
and is ideally suited for automated unit testing of web sites when combined with a
Java unit test framework such as <A HREF="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.
It was designed and implemented by <a href="mailto:russgold@users.sourceforge.net">Russell Gold.</a></blockquote>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<blockquote>A rudimentary <A HREF="doc/Cookbook.html">User's manual</A> is
available, as are a <a href="doc/tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>, a <A HREF="doc/faq.html">FAQ</A> and
the <A HREF="doc/api/index.html">javadoc</A>.
Several working example files come with the distribution download.<br />
In addition, Wiley press has published
<a href="http://www.wiley.com/Corporate/Website/Objects/Products/0,9049,1847817,00.html">
<i>Java Tools for Extreme Programming: Mastering Open Source Tools, including Ant, JUnit, and Cactus</i></a>
which contains two chapters dealing with HttpUnit.</blockquote>

<h2>Where do I get releases?</h2>
<blockquote>Releases of HttpUnit are available
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6550"> the project download page.</a>
<br>Other builds are available from <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/prerelease">the pre-release directory</a>.
