<H1>HttpUnit</H1>

<P>Automated unit testing is a great way to ensure that code being
maintained works and continues to work. The <A HREF="http://www.XProgramming.com/">Extreme
Programming</A> (XP) methodology relies heavily on it, and practitioners
have available to them a range of <A HREF="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">unit
testing frameworks</A>, which work by making direct calls to the
code being tested. But what if you want to test a web application?
HttpUnit is a library which makes this possible. Written in Java,
HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, including
form submission, cookies and automatic page forwarding, and allows
Java test code to examine returned pages as either text or an
XML DOM.</P>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<blockquote><strong>HttpUnit</strong> is a Java API for accessing web sites without a browser, and is thus intended either for automated
unit testing of web sites when combined with a Java unit test framework such as <A HREF="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">JUnit</a>. 
It is designed 
and implemented by <a href="mailto:russgold@users.sourceforge.net">Russell Gold.</a></blockquote>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<blockquote>A rudimentary <A HREF="doc/CookBook.html">User's manual</A> is available, as is 
the <A HREF="doc/api/index.html">javadoc</A>.
Several working example files come with the distribution download.</blockquote>

<h2>Where do I get releases?</h2>
<blockquote>The latest release of HttpUnit is available 
<var:dist> from the <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net"><var:dist> HttpUnit home page</A>
<var:publish as a <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/releases/httpunit_<version>.zip"><var:publish zip file</A>
.</blockquote>
 
<h2>How do I contribute, give feedback, fix bugs and so on?</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have a <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/httpunit-develop">mailing list</a> for discussion of 
the code.
<li>Read-only access to the CVS "<b>HttpUnit</b>" repository is available both 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=httpunit">online</a> as well as with 
a cvs client, accessing the repository at <code>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.httpunit.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/httpunit</code>.
