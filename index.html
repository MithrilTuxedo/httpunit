<P>The normal way to access web sites is via a browser; however, there are times when it is desirable to
bypass the browser and access a site from a program, including:
<UL><LI><A HREF="doc/automated-testing.html">automated web site testing</A>
<LI>using a web-site as part of a distributed application</UL>

HttpUnit makes this easy. Written in Java,
HttpUnit emulates the relevant portions of browser behavior, including
form submission, basic <A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt">http authentication</A>, 
cookies and automatic page redirection, and allows
Java test code to examine returned pages as text, an XML DOM, or containers of forms, tables, and links.</P>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<blockquote>

<strong>HttpUnit</strong> is a free, <A HREF="doc/license.html">open source</A> Java API for accessing web sites without a browser, 
and is ideally suited for automated unit testing of web sites when combined with a 
Java unit test framework such as <A HREF="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>. 
It was designed and implemented by <a href="mailto:russgold@users.sourceforge.net">Russell Gold.</a></blockquote>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<blockquote>A rudimentary <A HREF="doc/Cookbook.html">User's manual</A> is available, as is a <A HREF="doc/faq.html">FAQ</A> and
the <A HREF="doc/api/index.html">javadoc</A>.
Several working example files come with the distribution download.</blockquote>
