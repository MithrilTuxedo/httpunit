<button> tag
------------
These have an optional type attribute with possible values: reset, submit (default), and button.

reset - currently ignored
button - to trigger JavaScript; currently ignored

only the submit value is relevant. Such elements should be treated identically with
<input type="submit">
except that it might be useful to allow getButtonWith to search for internal text...
