<A NAME="Cannot unzip"><H2>Why can't I unzip the download library?</H2></A>
HttpUnit is archived using the classes in the java.util.zip package. Some older Unzip programs cannot understand this format.
If you are using WinZip, stick to version 7.0 or later.

<A NAME="org.xml.sax"><H2>What is the org.xml.sax package?</H2></A>
You may be getting compile or runtime errors asking for the org.xml.sax package. This package is found in JTidy, the HTML parser used
by HttpUnit. You should download Jtidy from
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13153">its SourceForge download page</A>
and install Tidy.jar in your classpath.

<A NAME="javascript"><H2>How do I use HttpUnit to test my pages that use JavaScript?</H2></A>
You should not have to do anything special; however, not all JavaScript constructs are supported as yet. See
<a href="javascript-support.html">the list of supported JavaScript features</a> for more information.

<A NAME="#norhino"><H2>JavaScript is not being executed at all. Why not?</H2></A>
If you do not have the Rhino JAR (js.jar) in your classpath, JavaScript features do not work.

<A NAME="proxy"><H2>Can I use HttpUnit through a proxy server?</H2></A>
Yes. HttpUnit uses java.net.HttpURLConnection, so the
<A HREF="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip42.html">normal Java way to use
proxies</A> will work. At some point HttpUnit may support this more directly, but for now, you will need to set the system properties yourself.

<A NAME="charset"><H2>Why isn't HttpUnit handling my non-English pages?</H2></A>
Older versions of HttpUnit (through 1.2) incorrectly assumed that all pages were in the default character set for the client platform.
As of version 1.2.1, HttpUnit correctly recognizes the charset parameter of the Content-type header which may
specify an alternative character set;
when none is specified, HTML 1.1 says that the character set is to be taken as iso-8859-1.
Unfortunately, some HTTP servers do not send this parameter correctly, and many browsers incorrectly use this
as an indication that they should
determine the character set in some other fashion.  To imitate this behavior, HttpUnit allows you to set the expected character
set for future pages by calling HttpUnitOptions.setDefaultCharacterSet(). This setting will not apply to those
pages for which the server specifies
the character set.
<p>
Non-English form handling is supported as well. Any parameter values entered into a form will be encoded as the same
character set as the document containing the form. The server code will then have to handle those characters
 appropriately. In Java, that would be converting them to Unicode with statements such as<blockquote><code>
String rawName = request.getParameter( "name" );<br>
String japaneseName = new String(name.getBytes("8859_1"),"EUC_JP");
</code></blockquote>
where the proper encoding should be substituted for "EUC_JP". The <code>getBytes</code> call is needed to extract the raw bytes from the parameter string.

<A NAME="buttons"><H2>HttpUnit is not finding the buttons and parameters in my forms. What is wrong?</H2></A>
This often happens when your HTML is not valid. Most browsers are extremely forgiving of bad HTML; however,
JTidy (the HTML parser used by HttpUnit) is not. It expects tags to be nested according to the HTML specification and
will reject any that are not. JTidy can display error messages to tell you what is wrong. To see them,
call <code>HttpUnitOptions.setParserWarningsEnabled( true )</code> before retrieving your HTML page.
Once you have corrected any errors, HttpUnit should see your form buttons and parameters.

<A NAME="#reload"><H2>Why do I get java.lang.IllegalAccessError when calling getResponse()?</H2></A>
<p>This happens when you use HttpUnit and certain versions of JTidy with one of the JUnit graphical test runners, which reloads
classes every time to run a test. Unfortunately, this places different versions of the JTidy
classes in different class loaders, so you get this error.  To avoid it,
you can do any of the following:<ul><li>Use only the text test runner</li>
<li>Disable all class reloading in JUnit by adding "loading=false" to <tt>junit.properties</tt> in your current directory</li>
<li>Disable reloading of HttpUnit and JTidy by adding the following lines to <tt>excluded.properties</tt> in junit.jar<blockquote><code>
excluded.10=com.meterware.httpunit.*<br>
excluded.11=org.w3c.tidy.*
</code></blockquote>
This will require extracting the file, modifying it and then putting it back <em>in the same directory</em>, but it should allow your
tests to reload safely.</ul></p>
<p>This problem appears to be resolved in JTidy r7, which is included with HttpUnit 1.4.1 or later.

<A NAME="#badPost"><H2>Why doesn't my servlet see parameters on a POST request?</H2></A>
Some older servlet engines, such as Tomcat 3.1, get confused when they see a charset attribute on the Content-Type
header. HttpUnit 1.2.6 sends this attribute; As of HttpUnit 1.2.7 it will only send it if you call
<code>HttpUnitOptions.setPostIncludesCharset(true)</code> before your request.

<A name="#hidden"><h2>Why can't I change hidden parameter values?</h2></A>
By default, HttpUnit verifies any parameter value changes against the form containing them. Since a user cannot directly
change hidden parameters, HttpUnit stops you from doing it in your code. If you have to change these values, you have a couple
of choices:<ul>
<li>If you call <code>HttpUnitOptions.setParameterValuesValidated( false )</code> before calling getRequest on your form,
the request will be created with validation disabled and you will be able to set any values you like. Note that in such a case
the order of parameters in the request is not guaranteed, in case your server cares about such things (servlets do not).
<li>You can call <code>&lt;form&gt;.getScriptableObject().setParameterValue( &lt;name&gt;, &lt;value&gt; );</code> to change
the underlying value in the form. This will behave the way JavaScript does - resetting the form will now restore this value,
rather than the original one.
</ul>
