<h1>Creating the Pool Editor</h1>
<p>Our initial task will be the creation of the simple pool editor, following use case 1.1. We will ignore
security restrictions that permit only the administrator to access this page.

To begin the tutorial, create a working directory and expand <a href="task1.zip">this archive</a> into it.
Either create a jars directory and copy httpunit.jar, Tidy.jar, and xerces.jar into it, or make sure that they are on
your classpath and invoke ant passing the classpath as a property.
You will write your code in the src/tutorial sub-directory.

Once you are ready, proceed to <a href="task1editor-initial.html">step one</a> to begin the tutorial.
