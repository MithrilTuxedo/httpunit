<h1>Controlling access to the application</h1>
<p>Only the administrator is supposed to be able to edit the pool, but there is nothing in the code written so far
which enforces it. The servlet API provides ways to restrict application to servlets. As part of this task, we will
use the Basic Authentication approach, which causes the browser to pop up a challenge dialog. The more common form-based
authentication is handled the same way that all forms should be. In addition, we will create a front-end page with links
to those pages a user is permitted to access.

To begin the tutorial, create a working directory and expand <a href="task2.zip">this archive</a> into it.
Either create a jars directory and copy httpunit.jar, Tidy.jar, and xerces.jar into it, or make sure that they are on
your classpath and invoke ant passing the classpath as a property.
You will write your code in the src/tutorial sub-directory.

Once you are ready, proceed to <a href="task2access-authentication.html">step one</a> to begin the tutorial.
