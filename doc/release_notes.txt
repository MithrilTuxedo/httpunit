HttpUnit release notes

Known problems:
    1. The "_parent" and "_empty" frame targets are not handled correctly
    2. The "_self" target only works for links, not forms
    3. The "accept-charset" attribute for forms is ignored; the page content character set is used to encode any response. 
       This behavior matches that currently used by IE and Navigator.

Limitations: HttpUnit does not support JavaScript

                            
Revision History:

04-Jan-01
Additions:
    1. Initial implementation of file upload capability
    
01-Jan-01 1.2.1
Acknowledgements:
    Thanks to Toyoshi Ushio for helping with the handling of non-English scripts and for translating the home page and cookbook into Japanese.
    
Problems corrected:
    1. Content-type charset attribute is now recognized, allowing for the proper handling of non-ascii html pages.
    2. Form submissions now use the page character set encoding.
    3. Old format cookie headers (with the expires=attribute) are now recognized.
    
Additions:
    1. Introductory ServletUnit functionality (parameters and sessions, but no JSP, no forwarding)
    2. Added getTableWithID method to WebResponse, ParsedHTML
    3. Added HttpUnitOptions.setDefaultCharacterSet to handle missing content charset headers, so as not to assume default encoding (iso-8859-1).
    4. WebConversation now has a new public base class: WebClient
    5. Any message header may now be defined, using: WebClient.setHeaderField and will be sent on all subsequent requests
    6. Forms may now be retrieved by their name attributes, using WebResponse.getFormWithName()

16-Nov-00 1.2
Acknowledgements:
    Thanks to Robert Krueger for providing an interface to the xerces parser for XML web responses.
    Thanks to Marco Tamanti and Gabriele Antonelli for suggesting ways to support file URLs
    
Problems corrected:
    1. Unnamed parameters are no longer submitted as part of a form request
    2. Searching for tables beginning with a string no longer aborts with NullPointerException if the table is missing cells
    3. A problem which caused WebResponse.java to fail compilation under JDK 1.1 has been corrected

Additions:
    1. Forms with multiple buttons are now supported, using the SubmitButton class.
    2. WebResponse now supports finding a table via its summary text, using getTableWithSummary().
    3. XML parsing is now supported. If WebResponse.getDOM is called for a non-HTML response (content type is not "text/html"), 
       the xerces parser will be invoked to treat the response as XML.
    4. File URLs (file:xxx) are now supported 
            
17-Oct-00 1.1
Acknowledgements:
    Thanks to Seth Ladd for specific exceptions from WebConversation.getResponse
    Thanks to Dave Glowacki for suggestions on convenience methods in WebResponse and WebLink,
                            and for correcting the set up of the https protocol handling.
    Thanks to Perry Doell for the methods to examine cookies on WebConversation
    Thanks to Ken Hygh for the proper handling of parameters with no specified type
    Thanks to Gabriel Hauser for finding a bug in the handling of parameter defaults
     
Problems corrected:
    1. The value parameter for checkboxes is no longer ignored
    2. Previously, getTableStartingWith[Prefix] only checked the nested tables in cell (0,0) of each outer table
    3. Parameters with no type specified are now properly handled as text
    4. Base tag is now handled to override defaults for page URL and target
    5. Empty parameter values are now handled

Additions:
    1. The license agreement is now available from the home page and javadoc
    2. Https support is now built in; however, it depends on the JSSE extension (not included). 
       See http://java.sun.com/products/jsse.
    3. Frames are now supported. The WebConversation method has two methods: getFrameNames and getFrameContents which
       allow manipulation of frames.
    4. By default, WebRequest.setParameter will now throw IllegalRequestParameterException on any attempt
       to set a form parameter to a value not normally available from the browser.
    5. It is possible to modify the behavior of HttpUnit via static methods on HttpUnitOptions. This includes:
       o enabling parser warnings (disabled by default)
       o disabling parameter validation (enabled by default)
    6. WebConversation.getResponse now throws HttpException if any 4xx or 5xx code is returned. The exact code is
       available from the exception
    7. WebResponse.getTitle() returns the HTML title of the page
    8. WebLink.getURLString() returns the URL string specified by the link in its href attribute
    9. WebResponse.getURL() return the URL used to retrieve the page
   10. WebConversation now supports getCookieNames and getCookieValue to return the current cookies  
   11. The WebResponse now can return the response code associated with it (2xx)
   12. Non-breaking spaces are converted to spaces on any conversion to text

       based on its text or the ALT text attribute of an enclosed image
    3. WebConversation.setUserAgent allows httpunit to pretend to be a particular browser
    4. WebConversation.addCookie allows the test to include additional cookies for the servlets to respond to.
